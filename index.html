  <h1>The Whole Foods / Cracker Barrel Indicator</h1>

  <p>David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report added an interesting meme to the narratives surrounding the 2012 election when he took a look at voting patterns in counties with a Whole Foods versus counties with a Cracker Barrel.</p>

  <p>In advance of the 2012 Presidential Election, Wasserman noted that in 2008, Obama won 81% of counties with a Whole Foods, and just 36% of all counties with a Cracker Barrel. That difference, the gap between counties carried by the winning candidate, amounted to what Wasserman calls a 44% "culture gap" in 2008</p>

  <p>Whole Foods stores, known for ther pricey organic offerings, tend to spring up in higher-educated, higher-income neighborhoods which tend to vote Democratic. Cracker Barrel Country Stores, on the the other hand, tend to be located in rural areas near highways where the population tends to vote Republican. Most people who regularly visit a Whole Foods aren't likely to regularly visit a Cracker Barrel, and vice-versa.</p>

  <p>In the 2012 elections the culture gap widened even more. Obama carried 77% of counties with a Whole Foods and only 29% of counties, widening the culture gap to a largest-ever 48%.</p>

  <p>The data Wasserman has compiled support the idea that America is geographically self-sorting more aggressively along the lines of several well-recognized divides: urban/rural, education, and income.</p>

  <p>With this cultural and geographic self-sorting now well-established, less and less Congressional districts are decided in genuinely competitive elections -- the demographics of the population (plus a little gerrymandering here and there) ensure that most urban centers stay Democrat and most rural areas stay Republican.</p>

  <p>Let's take a look at our first map, US counties by their 2012 election results (red is for Romney, blue is for Obama, the darker shades indicate a higher percentage).</p>
